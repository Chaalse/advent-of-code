# Avent of Code

Repository with AoC templates and solutions from 2024 and on.
There's a NodeJs script that fetches the input for each day and stores it in a ".txt" file

## Usage

To use the fetchData script you need Node version >= 16.4.3.

To download project dependencies perform npm install within the 2024 folder.

To fetch the input use node fetchData.js <DayToFetch>

Your input will be downloaded and a CLI message will tell you so.

And that's all folks!
